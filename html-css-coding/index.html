					        <p>The megalodon’s size grew proportionally to how big their main prey was, they hunted smaller animals such as seals and other ocean creatures, but the appearance of whales affected the growth of the prehistoric shark until the size of what we know of</p>
						    <p>When their main diet, the whales began migrating to other places such as the north and south pole, other much smaller and nimbler sharks started to appear and the once, king of the ocean, began to have competition for food. With the megalodon’s size, it simply had no chance to compete with much smaller sharks such as the great white shark for food</p>
						    <p>The main reason for the megalodon's extinction isn't because they were hunted but primarily because of the migration of their main source of food(whales), and the appearance of much more nimble predators such as great white sharks and several more smaller kind of sharks</p>
